This is an incorrect proof

Reduction
Given an instance of the REACHABILITY problem; a graph $G=(V,E)$ and two vertices $s,t$, we need a reduction in logarithmic space to the SHORT PATH problem. We do this by creating a new graph $G'=(V',E')$ where $V'=E \cup \{s',t'\}$ and $E'=\{((u_1,u_2),(v_1,v_2))\in V'^2 \mid u_2 = v_1\} \cup \{(s',(u_1,u_2)) \in V'^2 \mid u_1=s\} \cup \{((u_1,u_2),t') \in V'^2 \mid u_2=t\}$ and $k$ in the instance of SHORT PATH would be set such that $k=|V'|$ because if k was greater than $|V'|$ then the algorithm would have visited one vertex more than once $\Rightarrow$ we are in a cycle and if $s \rightarrow t$ on this path then could be reached on the same path with the cycle removed in smaller length. This can clearly be done in logarithmic space.\\

Proof of correspondence
To prove the correctness of the above reduction we need to prove the correspondence of yes instances. This means that we have a yes instance of REACHABILITY $\iff$ we have a yes instance of SHORT PATH. \\
($\Rightarrow$) Suppose we have a yes instance of REACHABILITY, this means a graph $G$, and two vertices $s,t$ such that there exists a path $s\rightarrow t$ in G. Take the graph G and construct the graph G' using the reduction above. Suppose that the path $s\rightarrow t$ is the set of edges $P \subseteq E$. We will now construct a similar path $P' \subseteq E'$. In $E'$ there is an edge $(s',(s,v))$ and an edge $((u,t),t')$ for some edges in $(s,v),(u,t)\in P$, and these will be placed into the path $P'$. For every pair of successive edges $(i,j),(j,w)\in P$ we have $((i,j),(j,w))\in P'$. We terminate when we see the edge $((i,j),(j,t))\in P'$ because this means our path go $s\rightarrow t$. We would always reach this termination condition because we are simply traversing the path $P$ from $G$. When we have covered all edges in $P$ we can see that obviously $|P'|\leq k$ otherwise, there would be a cycle as discussed above. $\therefore $ yes instance for REACHABILITY $\Rightarrow $ yes instance for SHORT PATH via our reduction.
\\
($\Leftarrow$) Suppose we have a yes instance of SHORT PATH which conforms to the reduction above. This means that we have a path $P'\subseteq E'$ that goes $s'\rightarrow t'$. We will now construct a path $P\subseteq E$ in $G$. We first construct $G$ iteratively over the vertices of $G'$; the edge set is $E=V'\setminus \{s',t'\}$, and the vertex set $V$ is constructed in the obvious iterative way; disregarding duplicates. When constructing the path $P$ over $G$ we disregard the edge $(s',(s,v))\in P'$ for some vertices $(s,v),(u,t)\in V'$. Iterate over the elements of $P'$, for example $((u,v),(i,j))\in P'$, and add $(u,v)$ to $P$. This path $P$ will include all of the edges from $s\rightarrow t$ in $G$ which is a path from $s$ to $t$, and hence $s$ is reachable from $t$ $\Rightarrow $ we have a yes instance of reachability. $\therefore $ yes instance for SHORT PATH $\Rightarrow $ yes instance for REACHABILITY. \\
$\therefore $ SHORT PATH is $\textbf{NL}$-complete $\square$
